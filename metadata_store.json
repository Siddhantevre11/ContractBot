This\npublication by the System Schedule Committee (SSC) will cover many aspects of the new reserve rules\nacross multiple volumes offering additional details and guidance to enhance a Pilot\u2019s understanding of\nUPA23 Sections 20-I and 20-K. Each volume will be built on the next and will address specific reserve\nchanges, providing the foundation for a thorough understanding of how UPA23 reserve rules will\nimpact Pilot pay, quality of life at home, and quality of life at work.\nThe format is structured for clear comprehension and to provide precise guidance with these new\nreserve rule changes. It also will offer additional insights and explanations, helping to clarify the\noperational and contractual changes for pilots bidding a reserve schedule. Throughout this document,\njust as in the UPA, if a word is capitalized, it\u2019s either a proper noun, or there is a UPA Section 2 definition\nassociated with that word (Duty Period, Pilot, etc.).\nThe SSC is committed to ensuring United Pilots are educated, supported, and ready for the upcoming\nreserve rule changes. Pilots considering a bid for a reserve schedule are encouraged to review each\nvolume of the ARGUP to fully prepare for these new negotiated reserve improvements. Knowledge is\npower and an informed Pilot group is the strongest and most effective tool we collectively have at our\ndisposal to ensure UPA compliance.\nDisclaimer: The ALPA Reserve Guide is interpretive guidance created by the SSC. It is not a substitute for\nthe official language contained in UPA23, nor does it supersede any obligations contained therein. ALPA\nstrives to keep this Reserve Guide updated.

        "chunk": "The ALPA Reserve Guide for United Pilots\nVolume 1 \u2013 Reserve Overview and New Reserve Line Types\nThe first step in mastering the new UPA23 reserve rules is to understand how a reserve is used for\nassignments and the expectations of a Reserve Pilot each day. The next step is to understand the new\nreserve line types available for a Pilot to bid on during monthly schedule preferencing and learn how\nthose line types differ from one another. The goal of this first volume of \u201cthe ARGUP\u201d is to cover a\ngeneral overview of the basic elements of reserve and to explain the new reserve line type bid options.\nUnderstanding these elements will give a Pilot clarity on which new Reserve line type might be the best\nfit for their work/life balance in a given Bid Period.\nReserve Overview\nBefore expanding on the types of reserve lines, pay, callout times, and assignment rules that are now\navailable, it is important to first understand the mechanics of how a reserve schedule will work, no\nmatter which reserve line type a Pilot is awarded. While many elements of reserve work rules under\nUPA23 are new improvements, some of the more basic contractual aspects of how a reserve\u2019s schedule\nshould operate day-to-day remain unchanged from the past and should feel familiar.\nGeneral:\nAll Reserves on a reserve day will begin on LSR (Long Call Reserve) just as in previous versions of the UPA\nfrom Section 20-K-1-a. Pilots will also be grouped by their days available for a reserve assignment into\nsilos, just as they have always been. (20-K-1-c) On a day of work, a reserve will either remain on LSR, be\nassigned flying, or be assigned a Short Call (SC) assignment (if their line type allows). A Pilot will also be\nable to aggressively pickup an assignment (Trip, SC, or FSB) during the published Seniority and Real-time\nTrip trade runs from UPA section 20-I-1. The aggressive pickup must match the Reserve\u2019s current silo or\nsilo -1. An exception to this is a Basic Reserve in the 6-day silo who can pick up a 4-day Trip that reports\nbefore 1000 Local Base Time (LBT). (20-K-8-b) Additionally, a Reserve can volunteer for an out-of-silo\nassignment they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be legal to pick up. (20-K-8-c)\nUpon completion of a Trip, a Reserve will need to check their Master Schedule after blocking in at the\ntermination of that Trip to see if they have been given an assignment or reassignment. If no changes to\ntheir flying have been made, the Reserve returns to LSR until they are given another assignment,\naggressively pick up (APU) an assignment, or released into days off. (20-K-1-d)\nA Reserve completing a SC, FSB, or training event is not required to check their schedule as they would\nafter a Trip, and they return to LSR until they are given another assignment, APU an assignment, or\nreleased into days off. (20-K-6-g)\nA Long Call Reserve is released at 0600 (1200 for a VEC Reserve on Long Call) on their last day of reserve,\nexcept that they are released at 1400 on their last day of reserve if the next day contains flying or",

The new Reserve line types do not change\nthe way our CCS Master Schedule functions or appears. In other words, what is displayed on the Master\nSchedule and the resulting schedule history available to a Pilot is still the official source of information\nPilots will use from a scheduling standpoint to ensure contractual compliance.\nOnly minor changes have been made to the information shown on the Master Schedule. The awarded\nReserve line type for a Pilot in that Bid Period is now shown at the top of the Master Schedule. There is\nalso a running count of SC assignments relative to the cap visible in the lower portion of the Master\nSchedule.\nThe SC Count/Cap will track a Traditional Reserve\u2019s running count of assigned SC periods. Only assigned\nSCs contribute toward a Traditional Reserve\u2019s SC Cap. For all other reserve types, this field will be blank.\n\u2022 Assigned SCs begin with an \u2018S\u2019 followed by the first two digits of the hour that SC begins.\nExample: S13 is a SC assigned by scheduling that begins at 1300. This assignment ends 14 hours\nlater at 0300 on the following day. These count toward the SC Cap for Traditional Reserves.\n\u2022 SCs that have been aggressively picked up begin with a \u2018C\u2019 followed by the first two digits of the\nhour that SC begins. Example: C09 is a SC that was APU\u2019d by a Reserve. The SC begins at 0900\nand ends 14 hours later at 2300. These are not included toward the SC Cap for Traditional\nReserves.\nTrip Assignments:\nThe order in which Trips are assigned in UPA23 will substantially change from the previous version of the\ncontract. This change takes place starting in the August 2024 Bid Period. A subsequent volume of the\nARGUP explains these changes and will introduce Pilots to the new Assignment Ladders from UPA23\nSection 20-I-6 at that time.

The order of assignment will\ndepend on more than just the silo and FIFO as it did in the past. The order of assignment will also be\nbased on the reserve line type that a Pilot was awarded that month. Knowing the nuances of each\nreserve type listed below will assist with a Pilot\u2019s awareness of where they might fall in the order of\nassignments and if that reserve type will ultimately be beneficial or not to their quality of life if they are\nawarded it in PBS.\nNew Reserve Line Types\nGetting to know the new line types is essential for a Pilot who is considering or is awarded a reserve bid.\nEach line type has differing assignment orders, pay, assignment notification times, and rules regarding\nShort Call assignments that a Pilot will benefit from by having a working knowledge of. Investing the time\nnow to learn the intricacies between each type will go a long way in aiding a Pilot who is looking to make\nan informed decision during monthly schedule preferencing.\nTRV \u2013 Traditional Reserve Line\nTRV Overview:\nTraditional Reserve (TRV) is the default bidding option for all Reserve Pilots unless they elect to bid and\nare awarded a different reserve line type during monthly schedule preferencing. The majority of\nReserves within a Category will be awarded a TRV Line.\nA TRV Pilot will start each day on LSR until they are either assigned or APU a Trip or a Short Call period.\nThey can aggressively pick up a Trip, SC, or Field Standby (FSB) in silo or silo -1 without additional\nrestriction. (20-K-8-b) Upon completion of an assignment, a TRV Pilot returns to LSR. They are not\nrequired to report for a Trip or a SC prior to 1000LBT on their first day of reserve but may APU an\nassignment that begins before 1000LBT. (20-K-7-a) A SC or voluntary FSB assignment that begins before\n1000LBT entitles a TRV Pilot to one (1) hour of Add Pay while a Trip that reports before 1000LBT entitles\nthe TRV Pilot to two (2) hours of Add Pay. (20-K-10-a)\nWho should bid for a TRV Line?\nA Pilot who doesn\u2019t want to start prior to 1000LBT on their first day of reserve and would generally\nprefer flying a Trip over SC assignments should consider bidding TRV. Pilots who don\u2019t mind SC\nassignments on occasion but don\u2019t want to be assigned to SC exclusively or excessively might find this\nreserve type preferrable. From a pay standpoint, a TRV Pilot is entitled to the MPG increases from\nunused SC assignments. They may also take advantage of the other Add Pay opportunities for SC\nassignments when applicable. In addition, a TRV Pilot is entitled to Add Pay when they APU a Trip or SC\nwith an early start on their first day of reserve. These potential pay increases provide the possibility for a\nTRV Pilot to break the Reserve Minimum Pay Guarantee depending on the availability of Trips and SCs\neach day.\nTRV Pay and Minimum Days Off:\nA TRV Pilot is paid the greater of their Minimum Pay Guarantee (MPG) or Line Pay Value (LPV) pay",

While it\u2019s not a new concept, this line type\ndeserves additional explanation since it was only available to a segment of the pilot group in the\npredecessor agreement.\nA Compressed Reserve Line (CMP) allows a Reserve to either have a single continuous block of work days\nor a single continuous block of days off within a Bid Period. (LOA 23-03 C. 2.) Until now, Compressed\nReserve Lines were only available to Reserves in Guam. (LOA 12-01). UPA23 has potentially expanded\nthis line type offering by requiring a six-month test of Compressed Reserve Lines in Global Categories. If\nthe initial Global Category test is successful, there will be a subsequent test for Basic Categories. Once\ntesting is completed, a CMP Line can be preferenced by all Reserve Categories in PBS. Testing will only be\napplicable to \u201cmainland\u201d Categories; Guam Pilots will continue to have access to this type of Reserve for\nthe full duration of UPA23 in LOA 12-01.\nLOA 23-03 Compressed Reserve Testing\nWhile Compressed Reserve Lines for non-Guam Categories have been included in UPA23 as a Letter of\nAgreement, as noted above, they will not be fully incorporated until a testing period has been completed\nto prove that this line type is able to achieve required reserve utilization metrics, as jointly established by\nthe Company and ALPA. The testing period will occur over six (6) consecutive Bid Periods and shall test\nCompressed Reserve Lines in Global Categories first (for both Captains and First Officers in each\nCategory). If the Reserve utilization of Compressed Reserves meets, or exceeds the utilization metrics\nestablished, the Company must continue to offer Compressed Reserve Lines in Global Categories for the\nduration of UPA23. (LOA 23-03 A. and D. 1.)\nA successful Global Category Compressed Reserve evaluation would then initiate the testing of\nCompressed Reserve Lines in Basic Categories. That testing period will also last for six (6) consecutive Bid\nPeriods and shall test Compressed Reserve Lines in no less than five (5) Basic Categories (for both\nCaptains and First Officers in each Category). If the Reserve utilization of Compressed Reserves meets, or\nexceeds the utilization metrics established, the Company must continue to offer Compressed Reserve\nLines in Basic Categories for the duration of UPA23. (LOA 23-03 A. and D. 2.)\nAs testing for Compressed Reserve Lines begins, Pilots are encouraged to learn the nuances of this line\ntype and bid a Compressed Reserve Line during monthly schedule preferencing if available in Category to\nensure an adequate sample size for testing.

This Volume of the ARGUP highlights the changes made in PBS that allow a Pilot to\nmake use of these new provisions. Pilots wanting an overview of how to preference a specific Reserve\nLine Type, how to preference for additional work days, additional days off, enhanced non-profile reserve,\nand strategies to avoid completion mode should find this information beneficial.\nThis Volume assumes that the reader is proficient using PBS to preference a schedule and is not meant\nas a training guide for bidding. The PBS user guide located in the PBS system provides specific guidance\non the mechanics of bidding and should be referenced for bidding strategies, and general use of that\nsystem. Should additional information be needed relating to monthly schedule preferencing, consult the\nPBS User Guide (CCS > Bidding > PBS > System Documents > PBS User Guide).\nBidding Reserve Line Types in PBS\nReserves have the option to preference the following reserve line types in PBS:\n\u2022 Long Call Lines (LCL)\n\u2022 Voluntary Short Call Lines (VSC)\n\u2022 Voluntary Early Check Lines (VEC)\n\u2022 Compressed Lines (CMP)*\n*For GUM (and Global Categories during the LOA 23-03 testing period, if testing is successful, a Basic Category testing period\nwill begin)\nTo preference one of the new line types, bidders will need to specifically request that line type in PBS.\nThis is accomplished by using a \u2018SET\u2019 command. From there, the specific line type requested can be\nselected. When bidding for a specialized line type, only one (1) \u2018SET\u2019 Reserve Line Type may be entered\nper bid group.\nExample:\nA Pilot wanting to preference an LCL Line over a VEC Line (assuming that line type is being offered in\ntheir Category) will need to make at least two (2) separate Reserve bid groups. In each bid group, one\n\u2018SET\u2019 command for that specific line type must be made.

        "chunk": "The ALPA Reserve Guide for United Pilots\nVolume 4 \u2013 Reserve Assignments\nThis Volume of the ARGUP provides comprehensive expanded guidance on how reserve assignments are\nmade. It is essential for Reserve Pilots to have a working knowledge of this process, as the order of\nassignments has undergone significant changes from previous versions of the UPA. Reserve Pilots are\nencouraged to familiarize themselves with these reserve rule changes as they are central to the new\nassignment methodology now being used. Understanding how reserve assignments are made and\nconfidently knowing the rules that govern these assignments are critical pieces in maximizing a Reserve\nPilot\u2019s quality of life under UPA23.\nWhen Trips and Short Call Periods Become Assignable\nBefore an assignment can be made to a Reserve, it must first remain open for a specified amount of\ntime, based on when that assignment opened. This wait time allows a Reserve to APU the assignment, or\na Lineholder to pick up the Open Trip before it becomes assignable to a Reserve Pilot. The amount of\ntime the assignment must remain open depends on when that assignment became open and is divided\ninto two groups:\n1. Assignments that become open by 1000LBT on the day prior to the assignment\u2019s report or start\ntime.\n2. Assignments that become open after 1000LBT on the day prior to the assignment\u2019s report or\nstart time.\nAssignments Open By 1000LBT the Day Prior:\nAn assignment that opens by 1000LBT on the day prior to the assignment\u2019s report or start time must be\nassigned in the assignment window for that Category and cannot be given to a Reserve prior to that\nwindow. The assignment window is the period each day that the Company must use to make an\nassignment that was open by 1000LBT to a Reserve Pilot. For Non-LCL Reserves, the assignment window\nis from 1200LBT-1359LBT. For LCL Pilots, the Assignment Window is from 1015-1359LBT. (20-I-1) During\nthis time, reserve assignments will be \u201cprovisionally assigned\u201d to Reserves. A provisional assignment can\nbe given to a Reserve and then later revised within that same Assignment Window. At 1400LBT, the\nassignment window closes, and all assignments become firm. (20-I-6-d)\nAssignments Open After 1000LBT the Day Prior:\nAn assignment that opens after 1000LBT on the day prior to the assignment\u2019s report or start time is\nassignable two (2) hours after it opens or twenty (20) hours prior, whichever is earlier, but never before\n1200LBT. Once a Trip or SC becomes assignable, that assignment must be made within two (2) hours.\nThat two (2) hours may be extended to four (4) hours if the Company is experiencing irregular operations\nat a Base. (20-I-6-e) The assignment may also be made earlier than the time specified above if a VEC\nPilot on their last day off is given an assignment with an early start that would not otherwise have been\npermitted due to the earlier start time.

Of the many new\nreserve items negotiated in UPA23, the most significant might be the \u201cassignment ladders,\u201d as they\nrepresent the foundation on which many of the new reserve rules are built. The assignment ladders\ndetermine how Trips/SCs are given and understanding the ladder\u2019s functionality will aid Reserve Pilots in\nanticipating assignments. The implementation of this new reserve system is designed to minimize\ndisruption to a Reserve\u2019s days off and provide opportunities for volunteers to accept assignments that\ncause disruption ahead of a Reserve being involuntarily disrupted. It also creates a more rigid and\npredictable process for reserve assignments. This structured approach allows Reserve Pilots to better\nforecast when assignments will be placed on their schedules.\nThe methodology for how the ladders work is straightforward. At the time a Trip is assignable, that\nassignment enters Assignment Ladder 1 at the first \u201crung.\u201d If there is a Reserve Pilot in that rung who is\nlegal and available, the Trip will be assigned to that Reserve. If no Reserve is available in that first rung,\nthe Trip moves down the ladder, rung by rung, until it reaches a rung that has a legal and available\nReserve for the Trip without disrupting a day off. (20-I-6-a-(1)-(d))\nIf there is more than one Reserve in the same rung, the Trip is assigned in the following priority: LCL,\nTRV, VEC/VSC/CMP (20-I-6-a-(1)-(c)). If there is more than one Reserve in the same rung with the same\npriority, the tie break is first-in first-out (FIFO). (20-K-2-a)\nIf there are no legal Reserves available in Ladder 1, then the trip cannot be assigned without disruption\nto days off. If the crew desk chooses not to split the Trip (20-G-3) or move the Trip to another Base (20-H-\n6-e), that Trip then moves to Assignment Ladder 2, starting at the first rung. If no Reserve is available in\nthat first rung, the Trip continues down the ladder, rung by rung until a legal and available Reserve can\nbe found with the least disruption to days off. (20-I-6-a-(2)-(f))\nFor Short Call Periods, the first two ladders are skipped (Ladders 1 and 2 are only used for assigning\nTrips) and Assignment Ladder 3 is used. At the time a SC becomes assignable, it will enter Ladder 3 on\nthe first rung. It moves down the ladder, rung by rung, until the SC reaches a rung that has a legal\nReserve who can be given that SC. (20-I-6-c-(2))\nAssignment Ladder 4 is used at the end of a Bid Period. If a Trip cannot be assigned within a single Bid\nPeriod and a portion of that trip carries over into the next Bid Period, Ladder 4 shall be used to make the\nassignment (Ladders 1, 2, and 3 will be skipped). A carry-out trip will enter Ladder 4 at the first rung, and\nlike the other ladders, will move down the ladder, rung by rung, until the Trip reaches a rung that has a",

The RAD\nprovides details about each Pilot on reserve that day so that other Reserves have a clearer idea of who is\navailable for assignment. When looking at an open assignment and comparing it to available Reserves on\nthe RAD, a Pilot should be able to match an open assignment to the correct legal Reserve (if one is\navailable) using the Assignment Ladders. (CCS > Trading > Reserve Availability)\nBefore discussing the specific functionality of the RAD and how to use the data shown in each column, it\nis important to understand that the RAD is a dynamic display and the data in the RAD updates real-time.\nThe information shown in the RAD is not static and will change each minute in the background. These\nchanges can be updated in the RAD at any time by reloading the page.\nThe principal purpose of the RAD is to show a Reserve\u2019s real-time availability immediately before, during,\nand after the assignment window, and should primarily be used for the current day and following day\u2019s\noperation. Other dates may be selected on the RAD and the sort order, reserve type, and silo are\naccurate for all Reserves on that selected date. The other columns might not show useful information\nbased on system logic for dates selected outside of the current day and following day.\nThe RAD allows Pilots to see a list of Reserves who are currently available for assignment on a particular\nday, and it is broken down into three (3) sections: LSR, SC, and FSB. Reserves are placed in the\nappropriate section on the RAD based on their reserve assignment for that day. Within each section,\nReserves are listed and sorted in the correct assignment order from the UPA.\nReserves on Long Call are listed in the \u201cLSR\u201d section at the top of the RAD.

This allows a Pilot to see how the RAD works\nwhile using the screenshot as the starting point before changes to the RAD are made. As the day\nprogresses, Reserves are removed from the RAD whenever assignments are made by the crew desk, are\nreleased into days off, or they APU a Trip, SC, or FSB. Anticipating how the RAD changes throughout the\nday and knowing why those changes occurred will help a Pilot have a clearer picture of how the RAD\nworks when the crew desk is making assignments using the Assignment Ladders.\nMaking Reserve Assignments\nIt is advantageous for a Pilot on reserve to have a general awareness of the process the crew desk uses\nto make reserve assignments. Knowing the steps taken to make an assignment will help a Reserve better\nunderstand why one assignment is made before another assignment when using the Ladders.\nWhen a crew scheduler begins their shift in the morning, prior to the opening of the assignment window,\nthey look at the open assignments for the following day. They also look at the available reserves on the\nRAD. The scheduler then begins to match available Reserve Pilots with open assignments in the order of\nthe ladders. The crew desk refers to this process as making their \u201clineup.\u201d As the morning progresses and\nassignments are picked up by Lineholders, or APU\u2019d by Reserves (once the APU window opens), the crew\ndesk must continually modify their lineup to account for these changes while waiting for the assignment\nwindow to open at 1200LBT (1015LBT for LCL Pilots).\nOnce the assignment window opens for a Category, the crew desk will begin to make the remaining\nreserve assignments using the assignment ladders. Any assignment open by 1000LBT on the day prior\nmust be made in the 1200-1359LBT assignment window (1015-1359LBT for LCL Pilots) while following\nall applicable assignment rules. The order that assignments are made in the ladders must allow for a\nsolution that does not disrupt days off, if possible. (20-I-6-a-(1)) If that is not possible, the order of\nassignment must provide a solution that allows for the least possible day off disruption when looking\nat the Category as a whole. (20-I-6-a-(2))\nWhen making assignments using the ladders, certain Trips may be assigned before others. The crew desk\nmay assign a Trip that contains a thirty (30) hour off Duty Period either before, after, or during a Trip to a\nCompressed Reserve (CMP) ahead of other pilots in the assignment ladders, so long as the assignment of\nthat Trip does not cause RDO disruption. (LOA 23-03 C. 4. c.) Trips requiring an Airport or area qualification\nfrom UPA Section 9-I may also be made in the ladders ahead of other assignments.",

This conversion can be made either electronically on\nCCS or via phone with the crew desk. (CCS > Scheduling > Reserve Schedule Modification) A Reserve\nelecting to make this VDO conversion will accomplish two separate actions simultaneously:\n\u2022 It signifies the willingness of a Reserve to voluntarily have their day off disrupted for the\nassignment of a Trip in Ladder 2. A Trip given in Ladder 2 cannot begin on a VDO. A Reserve Pilot\nvolunteering for disruption in Ladder 2 can only be used to disrupt a day off for a Trip that begins\non a reserve day.\n\u2022 It signifies the willingness of a Reserve to make themselves available for a VDO Assignment from\nUPA 20-I-14. A VDO assignment from 20-I-14 can begin on a VDO and a Reserve Pilot is not\nrequired to accept an offered assignment.\nThe conversion of a day off to a VDO fulfills both the above components. A Reserve cannot\nindependently make an election to only have one of those two actions take place and not the other.\nOnce a Reserve elects to convert a day off to a VDO, that conversion may be withdrawn at any time, with\ntwo exceptions:\n1. When contactable, a Reserve may not withdraw the conversion at time of assignment. (5-E-8-a)\n2.

If the SC is not notified of this, they are not required to sit the SC and it\nwill be considered as unused. (20-K-6-h)\nSC Assignment Rules\nFor the assignment of Short Call Periods, the first two ladders are skipped (Ladders 1 and 2 are only used\nfor assigning Trips) and Assignment Ladder 3 is used. At the time a SC becomes assignable, it will enter\nLadder 3 at the first rung. If a legal Reserve is not available in that rung, the crew desk will move down\nthe ladder, rung by rung, until they reach a rung with a legal Reserve who can be assigned that SC. (20-I-\n6-c-(2))\nIf there are multiple Reserves within a rung, the SC is given to the Reserve with the highest line type\npriority order. The Ladder 3 line type priority order differs slightly from the other ladders and it ensures\nthe assignment of a SC Period is given first to a Reserve not subject to the SC Cap (VEC/VSC/CMP), if\nable.

The SC Headroom Ratio for a TRV Pilot could be as high as six hundred percent\n(600%).

This matrix shows the crew desk\nwhat SCs should be built. The same SC Matrix that the crew desk uses is published each Bid Period for\nPilots and provides an awareness of what SCs are being planned for each day within a Category. The\nquantity and start time of each SC is derived based on actual departures, historical SC utilization rates,\nand planned staffing levels for the Bid Period. (CCS > Scheduling > Short Call Matrix)\nThe SC Matrix is subdivided by priorities and contains two categories: \u201cblue sky\u201d and \u201cIRROPS.\u201d On a\n\u201cblue sky\u201d day (when no adverse weather is expected), the company may build SCs for each priority\nlisted on the SC Matrix. The crew desk is not required to build out each SC in priority order and may skip\npriorities if they choose. When irregular operations are forecasted, the crew desk may increase the total\nnumber of SCs built up to the IRROPS limit published on the SC Matrix. Those increased Short Calls may\nhave differing start times from the priorities published on the \u201cblue sky\u201d category. In exceptional\ncircumstances, the number of SCs built might exceed the IRROPS category. When the actual building of\nSCs exceeds what is published in the SC Matrix, those builds are shared and reviewed with the SSC. (20-\nK-6-l)\nNovember 2024 55\n2024",

It benefits a Reserve to have a working knowledge of the timelines and\nlimitations with these methods to ensure a Reserve receives a Trip, SC, or FSB that\u2019s been requested for\npickup. Understanding how to pick up assignments can assist a Reserve by providing additional control\nand predictability with their schedule.\nThis volume of the ALPA Reserve Guide covers a general overview of the trade runs available and what\nassignments may be picked up based on a Reserve\u2019s line type. It assumes the reader is comfortable with\nthe functionality of trip trading and only discusses the differences between Reserve line types and new\nrules that apply to those line types. A comprehensive guide on trading is found in CCS and additional\ninformation is provided there on system use. (CCS > Help > Trading and CCS > Help > Scheduling)\nAPU Rules by Reserve Line Type\nEach reserve line type has different timelines and rules involving how a Trip, SC, or FSB is picked up.\nUnderstanding each line type and the APU rules that govern what a Reserve may be awarded will assist\nthat Pilot in knowing what assignments to request, and when that request should be made.\nAPU Silo Rules\nBefore discussing each line type, it\u2019s important to understand the way silo impacts the award of a\nrequested pickup, since this applies evenly to all reserve types. For a Reserve on LSR (i.e. not on a day\noff, Trip, SC, etc.), their current day is counted as a reserve day until 1400LBT. (20-K-8-b-(1)) For example,\nif a Reserve on LSR is currently in the five (5) day silo, they are considered as being in the five (5) day silo\nwhen attempting to APU for the following day until 1400LBT. In this case, the Reserve can only APU\nassignments for the following day that are built for the four (4) day silo (since they are currently in the\nfive (5) day silo and can pick up to minus one (-1)). The example below shows a Reserve on LSR in the\nfive (5) day silo who is attempting to pick up a three (3) day Trip for the following day. This request will\nnot be awarded and is considered \u201cout of silo\u201d due to it being prior to 1400LBT.\n5 Day Reserve on LSR Before 1400 LBT\nCurrent Day Next Day\nSilo 5 4 3 2 1\n3-Day Trip (Silo -2) [Will not award]\nAt or after 1400LBT, the current day is no longer counted as a reserve day and a Reserve on LSR can pick\nup either a four (4) day assignment or three (3) day assignment for the following day.

This system is used to preference criteria and make specific assignment requests. It is\naccessed via CCS and a request must be submitted prior to the start of the runs listed below to be\nincluded in the run.

(20-P-3-e) This run is called a \u201cFirst\nLook\u201d run. First Look runs are generated any time a Trip, SC, or FSB becomes open in the Real Time\nwindow for the current or following day. First Look runs are like Real Time runs in that they are pick up\nonly runs.\nFirst Look runs generated on the current day include all pilots in seniority order that have submitted a\nvalid criteria pickup request.\nFirst Look runs generated for the following day between 0945 and 1044 only include Lineholder or LCL\npilots that have submitted a valid criteria pickup request.

In other words, a VEC can APU an\nassignment on their last day off that reports after 1000LBT, so long as it was picked up after 1600LBT the\nday prior.

This information should be viewed as a general overview of additional reserve\nitems from UPA23 and it is not exhaustive. While most of the items included in this volume are specific to\nReserves, some elements apply to Lineholders as well.\nThere are certain terms used in this volume that have quotations around them (\u201cshow no go\u201d, \u201crapid\nreport\u201d, etc.). These indicate the name that Crew Scheduling colloquially uses when referring to a particular\ncontractual item. While these terms are not specifically found in the UPA, knowing them could assist a Pilot\nwhen communicating with a scheduler at the Crew Desk.\nAs with all the information provided in the ARGUP, a Reserve wanting to better understand a particular\nsubject should seek additional guidance from the UPA using the Sections quoted herein.\nChanging Bases on Reserve\nWhen a Reserve changes their Base, they are entitled to a minimum Off-Duty Period after their last Trip, or\nreserve block of the current Bid Period before beginning a block of reserve days in their new Base. The Off-\nDuty Period is calculated based on the scheduled Arrival of the first online flight between the Bases\nfollowing the completion of the Pilot\u2019s last event for that Bid Period plus ten (10) hours if the new Base is in\nthe same time zone as the previous Base or thirty (30) hours if the new Base is in a different time zone\nfrom the previous Base.

If a Reserve does not have the required Off-Duty Period, their schedule\nwill require a repair. A Reserve can expect to see a BRK (Break) or RLFD (Released Full Day) code placed in\ntheir Master Schedule to achieve this Off-Duty Period. These codes will not impact a Pilot\u2019s pay and their\nReserve MPG will remain unchanged by the placement of these codes. If a schedule repair has not been\ninitiated by the company at the completion of the last event in Bid Period \u201cA\u201d, a Pilot should call the\nFutures Desk and request their schedule be repaired.\nA Reserve with a block of reserve days that crosses between Bid Periods from the old Base to their new\nBase has the option to continue that block of reserve days at their old Base, or they may elect to start the\nblock of reserve days at their new Base.

(5-E-6-d) A VDO assignment provides a pay incentive for Reserves electing to work on a\nday off.

Once a Reserve has\nmade the election to convert a day off to a VDO, that conversion may be withdrawn at any time, with two\nexceptions:\n1.

His LPV\nremains at 80 hours, his PTC also remains at 80 hours, and he will receive 15 hours of SRM\nAdd Pay.\nIf the SRM trip of 15 hours then cancels prior to report (Section 20-F-1-a), his PTC will remain\nat 80 hours, his LPV will drop to 60 hours, since the trip carried 20 hours of pay protection,\nand the 15 hours of SRM Add Pay is removed.\nIf the Pilot is then assigned a 17 hour trip on the availability days, his PTC remains at 80, his\nLPV increases to 80 (due to the 20 hours of pay protection), and he will receive 17 hours of\nSRM Add Pay. If he is not used on the availability days, his PTC remains at 80, LPV remains at\n60, and no SRM Add Pay is accrued.\n3-C-3-e The pay value of a Flight shall attach to the Bid Period that contains the Flight\u2019s\noriginal scheduled local Departure time. However, the pay value of a Flight whose Departure\nis delayed by twenty-two (22) hours or more shall attach to the Bid Period that contains the\nFlight\u2019s actual Departure time. Notwithstanding the above, if a Trip reports and releases\nentirely within a Bid Period, as measured by the time at the Pilot\u2019s Base, then the entire pay\nvalue of that Trip shall attach to that Bid Period.\n3-C-3-f Once a Flight departs, a Pilot shall accumulate pay value as outlined in Section 3-C-3-b\nregardless of whether the Flight cancels or terminates at a location other than the scheduled\ndestination.\n3-C-3-g Reserve Call Out Pay.

When a Reserve is contactable (i.e.,\nhe is required to be phone available), he may not withdraw the conversion at the time of\nassignment or between 1100 and 1400. If the Company actually disrupts a VDO(s), the Reserve\nshall receive fifty percent (50%) Add Pay for all scheduled Flight Time and Deadhead Time on\nand after the VDOs through and including the day the Trip ends (including reserve days), with\na minimum Add Pay of two hours and thirty minutes (2:30) per disrupted VDO, averaged\nacross all disrupted VDOs in the trip on an \u2018hours\u2019 basis. If the disruption was allowable\nwithout the conversion to VDO, the Pilot shall not receive such Add Pay for that day or days.\nExample: A Reserve is assigned a three-day Trip. Days 1 and 2 are on VDO days, and Day 3 is\non a reserve day. Assume the Trip has six hours of scheduled block and deadhead on Day 1,\ntwo such hours on Day 2, and eight such hours on Day 3. The Reserve is guaranteed 5:00 of\nVDO Add Pay over Days 1 and 2, or an additional 1:00 over the 50% of eight hours of\nscheduled block and deadhead on those days. His total VDO Add Pay is 50% x 16:00 + 1:00 =\n9:00. Now assume the Trip has six hours of scheduled block and deadhead on Day 1, four\nsuch hours on Day 2, and one such hour on Day 3. The guarantee of 5:00 of VDO Add Pay\nover Days 1 and 2 is met by 50% of ten hours of scheduled block and deadhead on those days.\nHis total VDO Add Pay is 50% x 11:00 = 5:30.\n5-E-8-a-(1) If a Reserve on a Trip involving VDO Add Pay is reassigned, the amount of VDO\nAdd Pay shall be based on, and determined after, the last reassignment. In other words,\nVDO Add Pay is not protected for scheduled Flight Time and Deadhead Time that is\nremoved as a result of a reassignment.\n5-E-8-a-(2) \u201call scheduled Flight Time and Deadhead Time\u201d shall include the portion of\nSurface Deadheading that is \u201cconsidered Deadhead Time for the application of Section 5-\nG-6.\u201d\n5-E-8-a-(3) VDO Add Pay shall not apply to assignments that are made outside of Section\n20-I-6.

This crew can expect Overtime Add Pay of 1:00 (3:00 at the 1:3 Overtime rig and none at the\n1:2 day off rig).\n4. Overtime Add Pay trip totals 1:00 of Add Pay for the trip.\nImputed Layover Calculation\n1. With an imputed layover time of 12 hours, the crew will return to their base at 0745LBT\n(CCO + 12 hours + :45 Report Time +Block Time)\n2. Because an imputed layover is used, no FAR 117 extension is taken.\n3. Since the crew\u2019s return to their base using the imputed layover is 0745LBT, this generates\n5:13 of Overtime Add Pay (Based on the originally scheduled arrival time of 1800LBT and the\nimputed arrival time of 0745LBT, 4:00 late at the 1:3 rig and 7:45 on their day off at a 1:2\nrig).\n4. Overtime Add Pay trip totals 5:13 of Add Pay for the trip.\nConclusion:\nSince the Add Pay provided by the imputed layover is greater than the Add Pay value with the\nExtension Add Pay, the crew will be paid via the Imputed Layover Calculation method or per 5-F-1-h-\n(7).\nImputed vs Actual Calculation for FDP Extension\nExtension :30+ Imputed 12hr Layover\n1 ETA 2300LBT 0745LBT +1\n2 Extension Add Pay None None\n1:3 OT Rig 1:00 1:20\n3\n1:2 OT Rig None 3:53\n4 Total Add Pay 1:00 5:13\nUPA 2023 117",

All Pilots employed by the Company\nview the safe operation of our aircraft as their primary function. Both the Company and the\nAssociation view safety as the overriding principle in the conduct of our operations.\n19-A-2 To effectively manage threats to safety, the parties have adopted a Safety Management\nSystem (\u201cSMS\u201d). This system seeks to mitigate risk through threat risk assessments and analysis\nof collected data, followed by corrective actions, and subsequent reassessments. The basic\npremise of SMS is acceptance of safety principles and collaboration with parties at all levels of the\nCompany.\n19-A-3 The Vice President of Safety (\u201cVP of Safety\u201d) and the United Airlines ALPA Master Executive\nCouncil Central Air Safety Committee Chairman (\u201cCASC Chairman\u201d) shall collaborate regarding the\napplication and administration of the programs described in this Section 19. It is the responsibility\nof the VP of Safety to ensure the effective application and administration of the programs referred\nto in this Section 19. To effectively administer these programs a level of trust and clear, open,\nand honest communication is required. Members of the Safety Action Council (\u201cSAC\u201d) shall make\nthemselves available to hear and discuss concerns of either the Association or the Company.\n19-A-4 The Company shall indemnify the CASC Chairman and any other Pilot member of the\nprograms in this Section 19, or his estate, and provide defense against any claims, whether by\nthird parties or by fellow employees, arising out of such Pilot's good faith performance of his\nduties with the Company as a member of the programs in this Section 19 unless such claims arise\nfrom the willful misconduct of the Pilot.\n19-B Safety Program Integration\n19-B-1 Partnership Safety Programs covered by this Section 19 are:\nFatigue Risk Management System (\u201cFRMS\u201d)\nFlight Operations Quality Assurance (\u201cFOQA\u201d)\nFlight Safety Action Program (\u201cFSAP\u201d)\nFlight Safety Investigations (\u201cFSI\u201d)\nLine Oriented Safety Audit (\u201cLOSA\u201d)\nThese programs produce data and information that may be sensitive in nature to both the\nCompany and the Association. This Section 19 sets forth the agreement between the Company\nand the Association regarding how the above mentioned programs, as well as Flight Data\nRecorders, Voice Recorders, and the ALPA Accident and Incident Go-Teams, may be integrated to\nallow a more comprehensive assessment of the entire operation.\n19-B-2 Safety Action Council\nThe SAC, consisting of the VP of Safety and the CASC Chairman, administers the programs defined\nin this Section 19.

For example, at 1700 on their last day off a Reserve (not a\nVEC or VSC) can be assigned a Trip reporting no earlier than 1100 because that is an 18-hour\ncall out and provides FAR rest beginning at 0000 on the first day of Reserve.\n20-K-7-d For the purposes of this Section 20-K-7, a \"day off\" is any day other than a day\n\"worked\" (i.e., a \"day worked\" includes: flight duty, reserve, reserve assignment, training duty,\nspecial assignment, other flight duties for which compensation is paid).

If a Pilot is reassigned more than once, the applicability of this\nSection 20-N shall be determined after the last reassignment.\n20-N-1-a On the EMB, CRJ900, A220, B737, A320 and B756 fleets, all lost days off shall be\nsubject to restoration.\n20-N-1-b On the A380, B777, B787, A330 and A350 fleets, any lost day or days off shall be\nsubject to restoration with the first reassignment into days off. For subsequent reassignments\nin the same Bid Period, restoration does not apply until the Pilot is below the originally\nscheduled number of days off as a result of reassignment. In applying this provision, schedule\nmodification(s) unrelated to the reassignment and restoration process do not change the\neffect of the restoration requirements.\n20-N-1-b-(1) Example: A Pilot is reassigned on the first Trip of the Bid Period into one (1)\nday off. To restore the day off, the Company drops a four-day Trip (which is subject to three\n(3) AV days of possible new flying). If the Pilot is unused on those three (3) AV days, the\nPilot now has three (3) more days off than in their awarded schedule. If the Pilot is\nreassigned on a subsequent Trip to return to their Base two (2) days late, no additional\nrestoration is required since after the reassignment the Pilot still had three (3) additional\ndays off after fulfilling the AV obligation, which is greater than the days off included in the\nPilot\u2019s original schedule.\n20-N-1-b-(2) Example: The same Pilot in Example 1 is unused on those three (3) AV days,\nthe Pilot now has three (3) more days off than in their awarded schedule. After being\nreleased from the AV obligation, the Pilot picks up a three-day PPU Trip on the unused AV\ndays (or any other three (3) days of the Bid Period).

Electronic alerting - Allow Pilot to be alerted to premium pay Trips, open time, awarded\ntrades, run times, and changes to Trips in stored requests. Allow for company\ncommunication (regarding system outages, etc.) as well as direct communication between\nsystem users. Generate message when coverage parameters are updated in a Category.\nd.

The lowest Reserve Coverage day in Trip\n2 is \u20136, and the lowest Reserve Coverage day in Trip 1 is \u20135.

The S&P \"National ASO FFS Total Cost Index\" (representing allowed amount trend for pre-\nMedicare active and retiree ASO plans) values as of December of the most recent prior year,\nwith 3 months of run-out, will be obtained for Medical Only and Rx Only (and Combined\nMedical and Rx for purposes of comparison). A Reweighted Combined S&P Medical and Rx\ntrend rate will be obtained based on the actual United Airlines proportion of incurred medical\nand Rx claims experience from the same period, applied to the S&P Medical Only and Rx Only\ntrend rates.\nAny adjustments to the Reweighted Combined S&P Medical and Rx trend rate or its underlying\ncomponents to reflect anticipated economic changes not already reflected in the S&P Indices\nmust be mutually agreed to by ALPA and United Airlines.\nb. A plan design leveraging factor will be agreed upon each year by actuaries representing ALPA\nand United Airlines and added to the Reweighted Combined S&P Medical and Rx trend rate.\nThe Reweighted Combined S&P Medical and Rx trend rate, plus the plan design leveraging factor\ncreates the Modified Combined S&P Medical and Rx trend rate.\nPart 2: Provided Health Care Trend Survey Result\nALPA and United Airlines' strategic actuary will each specify a preferred and an alternate independent\npublished health care trend survey source.

The parties agree to the following regarding the \"HIMS Benefit\":\n(a) Section 24-H-13 of the collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the\nAssociation (the \"CBA\") provides a special drug, alcohol, and substance abuse benefit (the \"HIMS\nBenefit\") for Pilots disabled on or after December 30, 2012 who participate in the Company's\nHIMS/EAP drug, alcohol, and substance abuse treatment program (the \"HIMS Program\"). The\nHIMS Benefit under Section 24-H-13 is limited to a lifetime maximum of 24 months. Pilots who\nreceive the HIMS Benefit are also entitled to receive certain other benefits as provided in Section\n24-H-14.\n(b) The Company and the Association hereby agree that, effective February 1, 2013, the group of\nPilots eligible for the provisions of Section 24-H-13 shall include the Pilots described in (i). below\non the terms set forth in (ii). through (v). below:\ni. The HIMS Benefit under Section 24-H-13 shall be paid to any otherwise eligible Pilot\nwhose disability date occurred prior to December 30, 2012, but who participates in the\nHIMS Program on or after February 1, 2013 (a \"pre-CBA Pilot\"), provided the Pilot\ncontinues to comply with all HIMS Program requirements.\nii. The HIMS Benefit paid to a pre-CBA Pilot (including any required gross-up for taxes)\nshall be paid for by the LTD Plan and not by the Company (except to the extent, if any,\nthat the cost of providing the HIMS Benefit to pre-CBA Pilots is reflected in future\nCompany and Pilot contributions to the LTD Plan), even if the Pilot is not otherwise a\nparticipant in the LTD Plan or the predecessor sUA or sCO disability plans.\niii. The HIMS Benefit for a pre-CBA Pilot shall not be payable for any month of\nparticipation in the HIMS Program prior to February 1, 2013.\niv. The HIMS Benefit for a pre-CBA Pilot shall count against the Pilot's maximum 24\nmonths of HIMS Benefit under Section 24-H-13, provided, however, that no period of\ndisability prior to February 1, 2013 shall count against the 24 month maximum.\nv. The provisions of Section 24-H-14 shall apply to a pre-CBA Pilot while receiving the\nHIMS benefit under this Letter of Agreement. The cost of benefits under Section 24-H-\n14 shall be borne as provided in the first sentence of said Section and not by the LTD\nPlan.\nvi.

The\nparties agree to explore modifying this procedure such that:\n5-A-1 A Pilot who had previously opted out can opt in with twenty-four (24) hours notice, or\n5-A-2 A Pilot can opt in and out via CCS (similar to SRM volunteers).\n5-B The Company shall provide all such Trips to the ALPA SSC for review before making them available\nfor pickup or assignment.\n5-C After the ALPA SSC has a reasonable amount of time to provide feedback, the Trip will be posted\nin open time for the appropriate Category used to hold the AMC/CRAF Trips that start with a\nDeadhead (e.g., SEA 777 FO). This will trigger an open pairing alert for the new Trip and will allow\nPilots to view the Trip before being called.\n5-D The AMC/CRAF desk shall wait at least sixty (60) minutes before calling the most senior Pilot, in\naccordance with Paragraph 5-E below, in order to allow Pilots time to receive the alert and review the\nTrip(s) before being called.\n5-E Trips covered by this Paragraph 5 will be offered in seniority order to all Pilots, from any Base\nwithin that Equipment, whose names appear on the volunteer list as it exists at the time the first call\nis attempted. The AMC/CRAF desk will call all numbers listed on each Pilot\u2019s master schedule. If the\nPilot does not answer, a message will be left at each number that allows voicemail. The message\nshould simply state (for example) \u201cthe crew desk is calling to offer an AMC/CRAF charter, if you\u2019re\ninterested please call the AMC/CRAF desk back at 872-825-xxxx.\u201d\n5-F The AMC/CRAF desk is not required to wait for a callback before proceeding to the next Pilot on\nthe list. This will be administered similarly to the SRM callout process.\n5-G A Pilot who calls the AMC/CRAF desk prior to being called in order to ask for a Trip will not be\nawarded the Trip until it is his turn to be called.\nLOA 12-13 502",

Additionally, Company\nconcurrence is required if (1) the Pilot has already reported for a conflicting Trip, or (2) his schedule\nrepair would create an open Trip whose report time is within twenty-four (24) hours of the current\ntime.\n5-I Once two-way communication is established with a Pilot and that Pilot agrees to accept the Trip,\nit is considered his Trip once the Crew Desk intentionally terminates the phone call. If the Crew Desk\nchooses to terminate the call without the Trip added to the Pilot\u2019s Master Schedule and subsequently\nthe Pilot is discovered to be illegal for the Trip, he will be subject to Section 20-F-1 reassignment for\nthe improperly assigned AMC/CRAF Trip. However, with Pilot concurrence, Section 20-D-4 may be\napplied.\n5-J Once a Trip is assigned to a Pilot and rebuilt for his Base it can remain in that Base if the Trip is\nsubsequently dropped back into open time. The Company will, however, continue to make the open\nTrip immediately available to all Pilots in that Equipment and seat, regardless of Base (specifically, for\nout-of-base Lineholders the \u201cstarting at 1300 on the day before the Trip reports\u201d requirement found\nin Section 20-P-2 shall not apply).

Prior to submitting an FRMS application to the FAA for approval, the Company will obtain ALPA\u2019s\nconsent. Such consent will not be unreasonably withheld and, if withheld, will be based solely on\nthe merits of the FRMS application. Such consent shall not be withheld for a mandatory second\nbreak seat; this clause shall not diminish the parties\u2019 rights under Section 5-J-11 Crew Rest\nOversight Committee. ALPA\u2019s reason(s) for withholding consent shall be provided to the Company\nin writing. However, ALPA may withhold its consent for any reason if the FRMS either seeks to\nraise any part of FAR 117 Table B above fourteen (14) hours or would require a change to the\nAgreement to be implemented.\n2.

Fatigue events categorized by the FRC as Operational or Non-Operational will not be\nconsidered to be an Attendance and Reliability event. Self-Induced Fatigue events may be subject\nto the Attendance and Reliability policy. In the event of a Self-Induced Fatigue event, an ALPA\nrepresentative from the FRC will inform the Pilot of the potential that the fatigue event may be\nsubject to further investigation by Flight Operations Management. However, the content of all\nFSAP Reports or any other required fatigue reports (e.g. IOR for fatigue) will remain confidential\nwithin the ERC and FRC and may not be used in any subsequent investigation of the fatigue event.\nF. If the FRC categorizes a fatigue event as either Non-Operational or Self-Induced, the Pilot will\nbe entitled to meet with the FRC in person to request they reconsider their decision.\nG. Fatigue events will be categorized in accordance with the United FRMP filing with the\nAdministrator on November 10, 2011 or the most current FRC documentation contained in a\nrevised FRMP accepted and on record with the Administrator.

Enhanced Company-Offered Leaves of Absence (\u201cE-COLA\u201d)\n1. In addition to the provisions of Section 12, the Company may offer E-COLA programs. Each\noffering may contain, at the Company\u2019s discretion, a combination of benefits, including but\nnot limited to vacation accrual, sick accrual, and adjustments to insurance (e.g., medical,\ndental, vision, LTD) premiums.\n2. Prior to the Company publishing a proposed E-COLA for bid, the System Schedule Committee\nshall have the opportunity to consult with and make recommendations on the terms of the E-\nCOLA.\n3. Once awarded, the benefits of an E-COLA cannot be modified.\n4. With Company concurrence, a Pilot who has been awarded an E-COLA may terminate his\nawarded E-COLA or be awarded a new E-COLA prior to the expiration of his existing award.\nAny such award will not reduce the number of E-COLAs available for award.\nB. The Company may offer an opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation\nprogram to eligible Pilots.

Provided the Company offers the Pilot at least three (3) different dates, which\nmust be at least two (2) days apart, for the landings class or recurrent training\nthat satisfy the requirements of ii and iii below, Trips dropped after the E-SRL\nexpires due to a lapse of currency will be dropped without pay. If a Pilot is\nprovided less than twenty-four (24) hours\u2019 notice prior to the scheduled\nDeparture from his Base for the event and declines the event, such offer shall\nnot be counted as one (1) of the three (3) required offers.\nii. A Pilot shall only be required to attend landings class or recurrent training while\non E-SRL if he is projected to lapse currency while on the E-SRL or within the\nfirst (30) days after the end date of the E-SRL. For example, a Pilot on an E-SRL\nwith a return date of September 1 shall not be required to attend landings class\nor recurrent training while on E-SRL unless his current lapse date is prior to\nOctober 1. A Pilot may waive this requirement.\niii. A Pilot shall not be required to attend landings class or recurrent training if the\ntime period between the scheduled Arrival time of the Company-designated\nflight from the Pilot\u2019s Base to the training location and the scheduled start time\nof the training event/landings class is greater than forty-eight (48) hours or if\nthe time period between the scheduled end time of the training event/landings\nclass and the scheduled Departure time of the Company-designated flight from\nthe training location to the Pilot\u2019s Base is greater than forty-eight (48) hours.\nThis restriction shall not apply if a Pilot\u2019s home of record is within two hundred",

Any Pilots bidding for a P-VSL award and who meet the criteria specified in Paragraph\nA.1, above, must:\na. Submit a bid for a P-VSL to Manpower Planning (submission method will be\ncommunicated via CCS message to all Pilots).

The Company, at its sole discretion, may award additional P-VSLs, by Category, to\nPilots between sixty-two (62) and sixty-three (63) years of age. In applying this\nParagraph A.5 to a given Category, the Company may set an eligibility cut-off\nbetween sixty-two (62) and sixty-three (63) years of age. The Company may establish\ndifferent cut-offs, in increments of no less than a calendar month, for different\nCategories. Any such award shall be made by seniority within Category, among Pilots\nwho meet the eligibility cut-off for that Category.\na. For example, for a particular Category (e.g., 777 CLE FO), the Company may set\nthe eligibility threshold at sixty-two (62) years and six (6) months. A junior Pilot\nwho is sixty-two (62) years and nine (9) months old could be awarded a P-VSL\nwhile a younger, senior Pilot who is sixty-two (62) years and three (3) months old\nwould not be awarded a P-VSL (because the Pilot does not satisfy the age\ncriteria).\nb. For example, the Company may set the eligibility threshold for 787 CLE CA at\nsixty-two (62) years and zero (0) months and the eligibility threshold for 787 CLE\nFO at sixty-three (63) years and zero (0) months because those are different\nCategories.\n6. For the purpose of awarding P-VSLs by Category, a Pilot\u2019s Category shall be the\nCategory the Pilot held prior to Bid 20-07D.\n7. Instructor/Evaluators shall be eligible to participate in the P-VSL program. For the\napplication of Paragraph A.5, the combination of the Pilot\u2019s status as an Instructor or\nEvaluator and the fleet upon which the Pilot instructs or evaluates (e.g., B737\nInstructor) shall be applied. A Job Share Evaluator shall be awarded a P-VSL if the\nPilot meets the eligibility criteria for either the Pilot\u2019s line position or Evaluator\nstatus.\nB. Initiation and Termination of a P-VSL\n1. Except as provided in Paragraph B.1.a, all P-VSLs shall commence on August 29, 2020.\na. The Company may, on a Category basis, delay the start of a Pilot\u2019s P-VSL by no\nmore than three (3) Bid Periods, based on manpower needs. Any such delay in\nCategory shall be offered to all awarded Pilots by seniority and assigned by\ninverse seniority, regardless of the Pilot\u2019s age.\nb. A Pilot who is on any other form of leave or program (such as a multi-month E-\nSRL) and is awarded a P-VSL shall convert to P-VSL as of the effective date of the\nPilot\u2019s P-VSL. A Pilot on a P-VSL will still be subject to furlough in accordance with\nSection 7, based on the Pilot\u2019s seniority (i.e., the Pilot cannot volunteer for\nfurlough), and upon recall will resume the P-VSL.\n2. A Pilot awarded a P-VSL shall surrender all Company property and exchange their\nflying crew identification badges for a non-crew United employee badge no later\nthan the first (1st) day of the Pilot\u2019s P-VSL.\n3.

Effective Date and Implementation Process\n1. The effective date of UPA23 will be September 29, 2023. Until a provision is\nimplemented, the Parties will continue operating under the related provisions of the\npredecessor UPA, or as may otherwise be agreed to by the Company and the\nAssociation.\n2. The earliest implementation of the UPA is desired by both parties and they pledge to\nwork diligently towards that goal. The parties acknowledge that by its nature,\npredicting implementation is imprecise, and recognize that technology and\noperational imperatives can affect any implementation schedule.\n3. The implementation dates contained in Appendix A, any conditions related to the\nimplementation of certain provisions contained in Paragraph C, and any interim\nsolutions for delayed implementation of certain provisions contained in Paragraph D\nmay only be modified with mutual concurrence of the parties or as otherwise\ndetermined by an arbitrator in accordance with Paragraph F. Should the\nimplementation of a particular item be delayed past the date specified in Appendix A,\nthe parties shall meet and discuss the reason for the delay and any appropriate\nworkaround or commensurate remedial action for the delay.\n4. In order to facilitate a smooth implementation of all provisions, the Parties agree to\ncontinue meeting to address any issues that arise during the implementation process.\nLOA 23-01 530",

Clarifications and Provisions Governing Implementation Timetable\n1. Unless stated otherwise in Appendix A, all provisions of UPA23 are effective with the\nstart of the October Bid Period, which begins on September 29, 2023. Items delineated\nin Appendix A shall be effective on the date indicated as the \u201cImplementation Date\u201d\nincluded therein, except as modified by Paragraph C of this Letter of Agreement.\n2. References to the first day of a Bid Period shall include preparation for the Bid Period.\nFor example, the implementation of amended Trip construction rules effective with\nthe first day of a Bid Period means the Trips built for that Bid Period will be constructed\nin accordance with the new rules even if it means that action must occur prior to the\nlisted date.\n3. For a Trip that crosses an implementation date, the rules governing the later Bid Period\nshall apply to the Trip. If both sets of rules would provide the Pilot with additional\ncompensation, the Pilot shall be paid the greater of the two amounts.\n4. The parties agree that a provision does not need to be automated, completely or in\npart, in order to be implemented. For example, if a manual process is available to\nensure additional pay provided within a new provision can be calculated, then the\ndelayed automation of the provision for payroll purposes shall not in and of itself\nprevent the implementation of the provision.\n5. The Company will meet and agree with the Association when prioritizing resource\nallocation related to implementation and when developing and implementing all\nautomation and manual processes.\nC. Provisions Related to Conditional Implementation\nNotwithstanding any specific implementation date provided in Appendix A, the\nimplementation of the following items shall be subject to the following additional conditions:\n1.

Enhanced CMPOOL is a new coverage metric that takes into account additional coverage\nconsiderations. Enhanced CMPOOL will allow coverage to be set and analyzed by reserve starts\nwithin SILOs on each day of the bid month.\n1. The reserve availability number per SILO, per day, will also look at all legalities for the\navailable reserves. This should include, but is not limited to, qualification status and\nUPA/FAR legalities. However, the system shall not consider any additional pay that is\nprovided to a reserve who is assigned a trip.\n2. The display will also indicate the reserve utilization for the bid month based on UPA reserve\ncaps. The reserves available number that displays would be the number of legal reserves in\nSILO that could start a trip on that day.\n3. The display will also include the current number of open trips in SILO on each day. An\nexample of previous Enhanced Pool is:\nLOA 23-04 549",

(hereinafter referred to as \"the Company\") and the AIR LINE PILOTS\nASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (hereinafter referred to as \"the Association\") desire to establish an\non-going process to conduct Pilot fatigue data collection to ensure crew duty and rest periods are\nsufficient to maintain alertness throughout Pilot operations and to identify potential issues regarding\nrecovery, and\nWHEREAS, the United Pilot Agreement (UPA) Section 19-C-4 governs such special studies, and\nWHEREAS, the Company and the Association agree that studies will be conducted under the\nsupervision of the Fatigue Review Committee (FRC) and may be in conjunction with a third party\nvendor and will address patterns of sleep and alertness, circadian rhythm disruption, alertness,\ncognitive performance, quality and timing of inflight rest, and fatigue recovery;\nNOW THEREFORE, the parties have reached the following agreement regarding the data collection\nprocess:\n1. When a Pilot volunteers to participate in a study, he will receive a briefing that describes the\nnature of the data collection study and how it will be managed, its length and scope, the\nprocedures and requirements of participation, and each participant's rights as a member of the\nstudy. Volunteer Pilots will be provided with a Participant Consent Form. The only involvement\nthe Company will have in the recruitment of participants is through general Pilot communications\n(which shall be well advertised) advising Pilots flying routes relevant to the study of the\nopportunity to participate in the program. Study participants, including the number of\nparticipants, will be determined by the FRC based on study requirements. If there are excess\nvolunteers that qualify, Pilots will be selected for participation in seniority order unless otherwise\nagreed by the FRC.\n2. Depending on the study protocols, personal data may be obtained through the Actigraphy device\nwhich is worn on the wrist similar to a sports watch, through a handheld PDA type device, and\nthrough Pilot-maintained logs.\nMOU 14-01 563",

The Fatigue Management Steering Committee will determine the compensation level for\nparticipating Pilots, provided all Pilots are treated fairly, in accordance with the following:\na. For studies utilizing an actigraph or similar device, or of longer duration (in excess of 30\nminutes), no less than $400 per Trip designated by the study.\nb. For studies that consist solely of events that must be completed at a specific time, either in\nflight or otherwise, or of medium duration (15-30 minutes) regardless of when the study\nmust be completed, no less than $50 per event designated by the study.\nc. For studies that consist solely of events that can be completed pre- or post-flight and of\nshort duration (less than 15 minutes), no less than $25 per event designated by the study.\n4. A Pilot may withdraw his participation and the FRC may terminate a Pilot's participation in the\ndata collection at any time via notification to the FRC. A Pilot who withdraws or is withdrawn from\na data collection study prior to its completion will receive a prorated payment based on the\nnumber of legs completed compared to the number originally agreed. Should a Pilot fail to\ncomplete all required documentation of a data collection study, the Pilot will be considered to\nhave withdrawn from the data collection study and will only receive a prorated payment for\ncompleted documentation. In addition, should a Pilot alter his schedule after he has begun\nparticipation in a data collection study such that he no longer has a schedule appropriate for\nparticipation in the study, the Pilot will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.\n5. All data collected will be de-identified to the maximum extent possible, except to identify Pilots\nfor compensation purposes. Each Pilot who agrees to participate in a data collection study will be\nassigned a participant number/code and all data will be de-identified in any reports or\npublications. The Company will not have access to identified data. The Company will not take any\naction (e.g. discipline, remedial training, counseling, etc.) against Pilots who participate in the\nstudy based on the information reported or the results of the data collected. All identifying data\nwill be maintained pursuant to the requirements of 45 Code of Federal Regulations Section 46.\n6. Pilots who participate in data collection per 3-a above will be permitted to review and discuss the\nresults of their personal data with the study analysts.\n7. The Company shall pay half of the flight pay loss for the Association members of the FRC for all\nFRC meetings, and all flight pay loss for work in support of FRMS applications.\n8.

Commencing with the LTD Plan Year beginning January 1, 2018, and continuing for each\nPlan Year thereafter while this MOU remains in effect, Participant payroll deductions for LTD\ncontributions for the Plan Year will be computed using an \u201cAnnual Benefits Base Rate\u201d (\u201cABBR\u201d).\nOnce established each Plan Year, the ABBR shall remain in effect for the remainder of the Plan\nYear, without regard to any increase or decrease in the Pilot\u2019s actual pay rate during the course\nof the Plan Year. Thus, any changes to pay rates throughout the Plan Year will not affect the\namount of Participant LTD Plan contributions for that Plan Year.\n2. The annual LTD valuation performed each year by the Plan Actuary will continue to\ndetermine the required contributions based on the Original Procedures. In addition, so long as\nthis MOU remains in effect, the Plan Actuary will annually determine the additional expense to\nthe Plan associated with the new ABBR Methodology (the \u201cABBR Expense\u201d), utilizing for such\ndetermination actuarial assumptions and methodology approved by the Administrative\nCommittee of the Plan. To the extent that the difference between the Plan\u2019s administrative\nexpenses for actuarial valuation purposes utilizing the Original Procedures and the Plan\u2019s\nadministrative expenses after inclusion of the ABBR Expense is greater than zero, the Company\nwill reimburse the Plan an amount equal to such difference, with interest equal to the Plan\u2019s\nassumed rate of investment return as in effect from time to time. Such reimbursement shall be\ntransmitted by the Company to the Trust concurrent with Company required contributions.\n3. The parties recognize that adoption of the ABBR Methodology for purposes of\nadministration of Pilot contribution payroll deductions by the Company primarily benefits the\nCompany and that, without the methodology adopted under this MOU, would entail additional\nadministrative expense to the Plan, a portion of which additional expense would necessarily be\npassed through to participating Pilots. The purpose of this MOU is to ensure that the\nadministrative burden on the Company can be fairly ameliorated without imposing additional\nexpense to the Plan or to participating Pilots. Accordingly, it is expressly understood that\nadoption of the ABBR Methodology with Company reimbursement of all ABBR Expenses, shall\nnot adversely affect Plan funding requirements, Company or Pilot contributions to the Plan, Pilot\nimputed income derived from Company contributions, the amount of benefits payable to",

OPERATOR INFORMATION. United (CALA) holds an air carrier certificate issued under 14 C.F.R. Part\n121 and conducts its operations as authorized in (CALA)s Operations Specifications (OpSpecs).\nUnited operates approximately 788 aircraft, and employs approximately 13,000 Pilot\nemployees related to this MOU. The Pilot employees are represented by the Air Line Pilots\nAssociation.\n2. PURPOSE OF THIS MOU. The FAA, United, and any participating labor groups are committed to\nimproving flight safety. Each party has determined that safety is enhanced if there is a systematic\napproach for employee groups to promptly identify and correct potential safety hazards. The primary\npurpose of the United ASAP is to identify safety events and to implement corrective measures that\nreduce the opportunity for safety to be compromised. In order to facilitate flight safety analysis and\ncorrective action, the FAA, United, and the participating employee labor groups agree to implement\nthis ASAP voluntarily. This ASAP is intended to improve organizational safety through self-reporting,\ncooperative follow up, and appropriate corrective action. This ASAP is based on a safety partnership\nthat includes the FAA and the eligible entity, and may include a third party, such as the employees\nlabor group or safety organization serving as an ASAP facilitator. To encourage an employee to\nvoluntarily report safety issues, enforcement-related incentives have been designed into the program.\n3. BENEFITS. The program will foster a voluntary, cooperative, nonpunitive environment for the open\nreporting of safety concerns. Through such reporting, all parties will have access to valuable safety\ninformation that may not otherwise be obtainable. This information will be analyzed in order to\ndevelop mitigation strategies and employee corrective actions if necessary to help solve safety issues\nand possibly eliminate deviations from Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations. For a report\naccepted under this ASAP MOU, the FAA will not use any enforcement action to address certain\napparent violations of the regulations. This policy is referred to in this MOU as an enforcement-related\nincentive.\n4. APPLICABILITY. The United ASAP applies to all Pilot employees of United and only to events that\noccur while acting within the scope of their employment with United and their contractors (if\napplicable). Reports of events involving apparent noncompliance with Title 14 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations that appear to involve intentional or reckless conduct, criminal activity,",

The ERC\nreaches a consensus when deciding whether to accept a report into the program and when\ndeciding on corrective action recommendations related to the reporter, arising from the event\n(except as provided in paragraph 6, below).\n6. AUTHORITY. This Agreement is entered into under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 106(1) and (m). The\nFAA retains all its legal authority and responsibilities contained in Title 49 of the United States Code,\nas referenced in FAA Order 2150.3 and in the FAA Compliance and Enforcement Program (as\namended). In the event there is not a consensus of the ERC on decisions concerning a report\ninvolving an apparent violation(s), reckless or intentional violation conduct, or a qualification or\nmedical certification issue, the FAA ERC representative decides whether to accept or reject the\nreport.\n7. TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. All ASAPs, whether new or previously established, enter as continuing\nprograms. A review of a continuing program is required every 2 years to ensure its objectives are\nmet. The review is accomplished by all signatories of the MOU.\n8. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL. Any signatory party to the MOU may withdraw from the MOU at any\ntime and for any reason. The withdrawal of a party, or the termination or modification of a\nprogram, will not adversely affect anyone who acted in reliance on the terms of a program in effect\nat the time of that action (i.e., when a program is terminated, all reports and investigations that\nwere in progress are to be handled under the provisions of the program until they are completed).\n9. POINTS OF CONTACT. The ERC is comprised of a management representative from the eligible\nentity, a representative from the employee labor group (if applicable), and a specifically qualified\nFAA inspector from the appropriate Flight Standards office for United, or his or her designated\nalternates as appropriate. In addition, United will designate one person who will serve as the ASAP\nmanager. The ASAP manager will be responsible for program administration, including the\ndevelopment and regular maintenance/updating of an ASAP manual or other process document\nthat defines the nature, policy, and procedures of the ASAP and its participants. In some cases\n(while not ideal), the ASAP manager is also the company management representative to the ERC\nand may perform both functions. Management officials (other than the airline representative) of\nany party to this MOU should not be voting members of the ERC and should refrain from influencing\nany ERC decisions.\n10. ACCEPTANCE POLICY. The following criteria are met in order for a report to be accepted under\nthe ASAP:\n(1) ASAP reports are accepted unless excluded by one of the criteria listed below:\n(a) Any possible noncompliance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations\ndisclosed in the report that involves reckless or intentional violation conduct.",

Part 91 to the extent required to meet that emergency. In considering accepting the report,\nthe ERC should evaluate whether such action may have been the safest course given the\ncircumstances at the time of the incident. If the deviation was the result of an event outside the\ncontrol of the Pilot or not otherwise evidencing a lack of diligence, e.g., to address a flight\nthreatening mechanical malfunction, the ERC may determine that acceptance of the report is\nappropriate.\n(b) The reported event involves criminal activity, substance abuse, controlled substances,\nalcohol, or intentional falsification. Reports involving those events will be referred to the appropriate\nFAA office for further handling. The FAA may use the content of such reports for any FAA action and\nwill refer such reports to law enforcement agencies, if appropriate\n(c) The report discloses an event that involves an employee acting outside the scope of his\nor her employment for the eligible entity.\nNote: The ERC may exclude a report that reflects an instance of a repeated act of the\nsame or similar noncompliance by the same individual due to a common root cause that was\npreviously accepted and addressed with corrective action under the ASAP.\n(2) Timeliness. In past iterations of ASAP policy, emphasis was placed on meeting strict time period\nrequirements as a condition for acceptance of reports. While timeliness considerations are generally\nstill a relevant factor in determining whether to accept a report, the responsibility of the ERC now is to\nreview all information available and determine whether acceptance of the report is in the best interest\nof safety. Timeliness considerations, however, do not apply to sole-source reports.\n11. EMPLOYEE FEEDBACK. The ASAP manager, in coordination with the ERC, publishes pertinent\nevent recaps, data, and trend information derived from filed and processed reports, and ASAP analysis\nin accordance with United\u2019s defined procedures. Any employee who submitted a report may also\ncontact the ASAP manager to inquire about the status of his or her report. In addition, each employee\nwho submits a report accepted under the ASAP receives individual feedback on the final disposition\nof the report.\n12. INFORMATION AND TRAINING. Each United participating employee and manager receives written\nguidance outlining the details of the program at least 2 weeks before the program begins. Each\nparticipating employee group also receives additional instruction concerning the program during the\nnext regularly scheduled recurrent training session, and on a continuing basis in recurrent training\nthereafter. All new-hire employees receive training on the program during initial training.\n13. RECORDKEEPING. All documents and records regarding this program are kept by the United ASAP",

The FSI, which involves a specialized investigation of reported events,\nis considered to be an integral part of United\u2019s safety reporting system and culture. As part of\nan FSI, representatives from United and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) (who are not\nmembers of the FSAP Event Review Committee (ERC)) interview a Pilot about an event he or\nshe reported under the FSAP during a flightcrew debrief. While the FSAP ERC does not\nparticipate in flightcrew debriefs, it provides input to the United and ALPA FSI representatives\nregarding the type and scope of questions the ERC believes should be presented to the Pilot\nduring the debrief. Additionally, the FSI representatives obtain and analyze additional data\nassociated with a reported event, and the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA)\nrepresentatives participate in the analysis. FSI representatives provide their findings to the\nFSAP ERC. After the FSAP ERC reviews the findings, it participates in discussions about an\nevent with FSI representatives at the FSI Incident Review Conference (IRC). Following the\nIRC, the FSI representatives recommend corrective action for the reported event to the FSAP\nERC. The FSAP ERC approves or modifies the recommendation for corrective action.\nIn view of this connection and information flow between the United FSAP and FSI program,\nthe FAA considers the flightcrew debrief and other data obtained during the FSI to be an\nextension of a Pilot\u2019s FSAP report and of the FSAP ERC investigation. As such, the FSAP\nprotections (see, e.g., FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 120-66C, paragraphs 16 and 20) and\nexclusions (see, e.g., AC 120-66C, paragraph 18)\nhttps://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.informatio\nn/documentID/1037363 that flow from the FSAP MOU to FSAP reports and to information\nobtained by an FSAP ERC investigation apply to the same extent to the flightcrew debrief and\nother information obtained during the FSI.

The new-hire Pilot shall be provided PS5 positive-space authorization for the two (2)\noperating cycles; the Pilot is not permitted, nor is the Company required, to book over the\npositive-space authorization levels. The PS5 positive-space authorization is permitted only for\nflights that begin and end in the forty-eight (48) contiguous United States (CONUS), except\nthat the authorization may also be used for any nonstop flights between DEN and Hawaii or\nAlaska that are operated by the aircraft type of the Pilot\u2019s initial aircraft training. For any\nflights arriving into DEN (or other city used for training), the Pilot must have a scheduled\nonline backup flight (including United Express). Both the primary and backup flights must be\nscheduled to arrive at DEN (or other city used for training) no later than two (2) hours prior\nto any scheduled training activity.\na. The Company shall develop and maintain a process for the new-hire Pilot to exchange\nseats, if necessary, with a United Airlines Pilot who is occupying a flight deck jumpseat;\nsuch process may include a requirement for the new-hire Pilot to check in with the\nflight\u2019s Customer Service Representative.

The parties agree to modify the Note in Paragraph G of LOA 16-01 as follows:\nNote: All fatigue events will initially be processed as Operational Fatigue in\naccordance with paragraph G-1 above. Subsequent to the FRC's categorization\nof the fatigue event, the Pilot's pay and sick bank for the fatigue event will be\nreconciled (if necessary). Additionally, fatigue events for which a Pilot fails to\nsubmit a FSAP within 48 hours after the start of the first calendar day off\nsubsequent to the fatigue event will result in a loss of pay. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, the 48 hour timeline for a given fatigue event can be extended by the\nFRC as circumstances warrant. In order to maintain robust fatigue reporting there\nwill be no requirement to file an Irregular Operations Report for a fatigue event.\nThis Memorandum of Understanding shall become effective the first day of the second\nbid period after the bid period in which the MOU is signed and shall run concurrently\nwith the provisions of Section 25 of the basic Agreement.\nPage 1 of 2",
